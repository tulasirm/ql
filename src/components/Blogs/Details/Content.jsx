              We all intend to plan ahead, but too often let the
              day-to-day minutia get in the way of making a calendar for
              the year. Sure, you can&apos;t know every detail to anticipate.
              Heck, you can&apos;t know half the priorities that will pop up
              in any particular month. But you can plan for big picture
              seasonality, busy-times, and events.
